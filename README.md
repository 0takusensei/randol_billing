# Billing

Society fund support for renewed/qb-management/qb-banking by default. Look at the config or change the addSocietyFunds(job, amount, reason) function in the server file.

Player commission for billing also optionally supported with a percent cut defined in the config.

Requirements are ox_lib and ox_target, although you can convert to qb-target if you have some braincells.
