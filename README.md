# Randolio: Billing

Society fund support for renewed/qb-management/qb-banking by default. Look at the config or change the addSocietyFunds(job, amount, reason) function in the server file.

Player commission for billing also optionally supported with a percent cut defined in the config.

Requirements are ox_lib, ox_target/qb-target.

**Note**: If you get an error for nil value (global GetActivePlayers), make sure your ox lib is up to date and contains the GetActivePlayers() function in the init.lua.
